        "Description": "To apply least-privilege security principle, one can create service-level administrators in corresponding groups and assigning specific users to each service-level administrative group in a tenancy. This limits administrative access in a tenancy.<br><br>It means service-level administrators can only manage resources of a specific service.<br><br>Example policies for global/tenant level service-administrators\n<pre>\nAllow group VolumeAdmins to manage volume-family in tenancy\nAllow group ComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in tenancy\nAllow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy\n</pre>\nOrganizations have various ways of defining service-administrators. Some may prefer creating service administrators at a tenant level and some per department or per project or even per application environment (dev/test/production etc.). Either approach works so long as the policies are written to limit access given to the service-administrators.<br><br>Example policies for compartment level service-administrators <br><br><pre>Allow group NonProdComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in compartment dev\nAllow group ProdComputeAdmins to manage instance-family in compartment production\nAllow group A-Admins to manage instance-family in compartment Project-A\nAllow group A-Admins to manage volume-family in compartment Project-A\n</pre>",

        "Rationale": "Permission to manage all resources in a tenancy should be limited to a small number of users in the 'Administrators' group for break-glass situations and to set up users/groups/policies when a tenancy is created.<br><br>No group other than 'Administrators' in a tenancy should need access to all resources in a tenancy, as this violates the enforcement of the least privilege principle.",

IAM password policies can be used to ensure password are at least a certain length and are composed of certain characters.<br><br>It is recommended the password policy require a minimum password length 14 characters and contain 1 non-alphabetic\ncharacter (Number or 'Special Character').",
        "Rationale": "In keeping with the overall goal of having users create a password that is not overly weak, an eight-character minimum password length is recommended for an MFA account, and 14 characters for a password only account. In addition, maximum password length should be made as long as possible based on system/software capabilities and not restricted by policy.<br><br>In general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable and undesirable. For example, requiring users to have a minimum 16-character password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren't hard to guess. Additionally, length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, like writing them down, re-using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents. <br><br>Password composition requirements are a poor defense against guessing attacks. Forcing users to choose some combination of upper-case, lower-case, numbers, and special characters has a negative impact. It places an extra burden on users and many\nwill use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a \"special character\" at the end). Attackers know this, so dictionary attacks will often contain these common patterns and use the most common substitutions like, $ for s, @ for a, 1 for l, 0 for o.<br><br>Passwords that are too complex in nature make it harder for users to remember, leading to bad practices. In addition, composition requirements provide no defense against common attack types such as social engineering or insecure storage of passwords.",

        "Remediation": "Update the password policy such as minimum length to 14, password must contain expected special characters and numeric characters.",

        "Description": "IAM password policies can require passwords to be rotated or expired after a given number of days. It is recommended that the password policy expire passwords after 365 and are changed immediately based on events.",
        "Rationale": "Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not limited to:<br><br>1. Indication of compromise<br>2. Change of user roles<br>3. When a user leaves the organization.<br><br>Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, it's been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password.<br><br>In addition, we also recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden.",

        "Description": "IAM password policies can prevent the reuse of a given password by the same user. It is recommended the password policy prevent the reuse of passwords.",
        "Rationale": "Enforcing password history ensures that passwords are not reused in for a certain period of time by the same user. If a user is not allowed to use last 24 passwords, that window of time is greater. This helps maintain the effectiveness of password security.",

        "Description": "Multi-factor authentication is a method of authentication that requires the use of more than one factor to verify a user's identity.<br><br>With MFA enabled in the IAM service, when a user signs in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, they are prompted for their user name and password, which is the first factor (something that they know). The user is then prompted to provide a second verification code from a registered MFA device, which is the second factor (something that they have). The two factors work together, requiring an extra layer of security to verify the user's identity and complete the sign-in process.<br><br>OCI IAM supports two-factor authentication using a password (first factor) and a device that can generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) (second factor).<br><br>See [OCI documentation](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingmfa.htm) for more details.",
        "Rationale": "Multi factor authentication adds an extra layer of security during the login process and makes it harder for unauthorized users to gain access to OCI resources.",
        "Impact": "",
        "Remediation": "Each user must enable MFA for themselves using a device they will have access to every time they sign in.

The private key is used for signing the API requests and the public key is associated with a local or synchronized user's profile.",
        "Rationale": "It is important to secure and rotate an API key every 90 days or less as it provides the same level of access that a user it is associated with has.<br><br>In addition to a security engineering best practice, this is also a compliance requirement.
